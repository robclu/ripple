# Ripple

Ripple is a library for optimized heterogeneous (CPU and GPU) compute for 
large-scale multi-dimensional spaces. It can scale to any number of CPU core
or physical GPUs on a node, and provides near-native performance compared to
state of the art libraries (such as cuBLAS), but significantly simplifies
development of large-scale parallel code.
